TODO:
- per-channel option to auto-rejoin when kicked
- write help files for all the plugins that are included in the base
  distribution.
- the bot's own words are not logged.  they should be.  right now the
  only bot action that shows up in a bot's own logs is when it joins
  a channel.  public and action, and I guess part should get logged too.
- sprinkle more debugging output stuff around, particularly in the
  class modules (User.pm, Chan.pm, etc.) since there's not much
  there right now.  if a user uncovers a problem in there, the
  debugging output won't pinpoint it.
- implement user-defined formats for things like logfile names and
  logfile entries.  could use % codes, like %y.%m.%d for
  year.mon.day .
- Allow configuration of which events justify notifying the owners.
  Also, possibly allow owners to specify which types of notifications
  they do and don't want to get.
- make the User package more robust...
  - users should have more info that other users with the
    appropriate flags should be able to access, ie:
    real name, last seen, last unidle, email addy, daytime phone,
    home phone, real address, etc... anything one can think of that
    would be useful
    -- these have been added, but we really need an entirely new
       user config file and format...
  - this info should be able to be set by each individual user with
    as much or as little info as desired... this means we need to
    both parse and save out a seperate user config file
- rewrite the define plugin to behave just like an infobot... or better yet,
  port infobot to a perlbot plugin... major props to anyone who does this

THOUGHTS:

- currently, users need to say '#help core ...' for help on the core stuff
  like part/join/note etc. (i.e. the stuff in PerlbotCore)  is this OK?
  perhaps PerlbotCore could become something else, like Base.  Also, it would
  be ideal to move all perlbot modules, plugins, etc. into a Perlbot::
  namespace.  I'm not sure if there's any required mapping between filenames
  and package names, so this might not be possible without a lot of directory
  rearranging and other hacking.
