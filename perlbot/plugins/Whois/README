This is a pretty simple one, two commands.

!whois somedomain.com 

will return 

<bot> somedomain.com is taken by data dynamics
<bot> Since: 10-Oct-1999

and

!whoare somedomain.com

will return

<bot> somedomain.com is taken by data dynamics
<bot> Since: 10-Oct-1999
<bot> somedomain.net is taken by 10Best.com, LLC
<bot> Since: 25-Oct-1999
<bot> somedomain.org is available.

(This last one came about from me being lazy)

This module requires a recent version of Net::Whois, available from your
friendly neighborhood CPAN mirror.

You'll want to keep the Net::Whois module updated regularly, since the
moving target that is Internic whois response formats has broken older
versions.

**** UPDATE ****
Strange how prophetic those words were when I typed them. Network Solutions'
switch to a recursive whois format made the version of Net::Whois I was
running obsolete. I am now using Net::Whois v1.9 and can verify that it works
just fine
